                    Our unusually beautiful covers are organically grown fabrics made from:
                    hemp, hemp/silk, flax/silk, and hemp/flax combinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    they are woven and dyed in the united states, contribution to the support and development of local farming, weaving and manufacturing communities.
                </p>
                <p>The yarns are grown naturally without pesticides or chemicals and do not compromise the integrity of the fabric.  Fibers in their natural state are generally three times thicker with increased longevity.</p>

                <p>These slip-off covers are available in solid colors and patterns. Their coordinated color palette is achieved using natural and low-impact dyes.</p>
                <p>Incorporating plant, vegetable and low-impact dying practices preserves our environment.</p>
                <p>CARE - Best to wash in cold water and air or low heat dry.   Dye lots may vary.</p>
